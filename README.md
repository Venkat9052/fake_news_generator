📌 How It Works
When you run the script, you're prompted to:

View history (history)

Clear history (clear)

Exit the generator (exit)

Or press Enter to generate a new fake news headline

The headline is formed by combining:

A subject (famous personalities, topics, etc.)

An event/action (funny or bizarre scenario)

A place (real-world landmarks or locations)

The result is shown as BREAKING NEWS, and optionally saved to history.txt.
